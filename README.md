# Linked Data and Semantic Web
**John Conor Kenny**

This project will display the number of households that own cars and the number of accidents on the road by area in 2011.
The datasets are from the RSA and the CSO Statbank.

**Datasets**
The datasets have been uploaded here. The RSA set is in .pdf format, so the data will have to be extracted from there and converted to a more usable format.

This README will be updated as the project progresses.
